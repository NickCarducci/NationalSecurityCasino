            would surely like to get your intentions with there being $70k/yr
            new cash per person and $300k/yr new promises on that cash, per
            person. You obviously do not intend to get the return you take from

            promising other peoples‚Äô money to yourselves and therefore
            counterfeit? Please understand all purchases will be reversed to

            Collateralized-credit is like a deposit, not an option where the
