        to jail them with, as trespass cannot house them, just chase them around

        5 auto leases, or 30 days (for hotels), so that demand is borne of
        actual labor, not implausible use rental-income.

        rollover, non-compete concurrentables - as opposed to the name your
        price tool of claim costs and expiring premiums, you can never be made

        "What are the reasons for the backward bending supply curve of labour?"
        <br />
        The microeconomic curves are in order of marginal propensities, and
        normal distribution has tails of outliers. So, it is natural for the
        most elastic propensity to be **eager** to sell/bid-proposal-with their
        hours, at the inception of the market. I would describe bottom left to
        top right *concave downwards*, mean price being lower than the median

        "Why does total utility increased as the consumer moves to an
        indifference curve farther from the origin?"

        Economic welfare, output or utility is more efficient productivity
        (GDP/hour, discounted by GDP/p tech deprecation), as **input costs is
        lessened by competition, or, **target margin operational network

        wins**, although the latter example is stated on grounds that I’ve found
        in surrendered freedom (EULA, third party donee beneficiary claimable)

        as Savers to loiter and launder instead of selling equity or profit
        share, max-profit royalty to keep equity relevant... The terms are still
        up in the air, but to me, a *pyramid scheme is rent seeking the initial

        matter, but BEA classifies new ***structures and investment as
        invariable for price-elasticity (flat marginal and therefore average of

        *Useless gentrification *is debt-“investment,” as a caste of actual

        not increasing amongst labor-competition elasticity, so population
        growth and scarcity is evidently not a problem. The problem of *useless
        gentrification* is that labor is part of input costs, and must be
        exclusively demand. These are my novel findings. Alternatives are
        required for reasonable doubt, so here are some: Truncated Sales Tax,
        p2p max-royalty, no general-income payday, await consumers, no

        Etymologically, transitory is a passive-adjective to a
        “transitive-property.” Jerome Powell has asked for more time to define
        the term. I believe the media is portraying the term incorrectly, as
        U.S. BEA does with “fixed” structural investment as startup, rather,
        discounting renovations, then. Input costs are a transitive-property of
        input costs, and that includes labor, profits, equity gains and bonds
        compounding over their collaterals’ principal, for an actual labor
        shortage over the same actual consumption, having a strange non-linear
        and curious relation between three factors of hours worked, GDP/p, and
        price. If exogenous defactorization and regression can use 1800–2020,
        GDP/p thru time shows 1913 rose price of out velocity of trade, by basis
        of m2 mutual fund stock gain and home as collateral, let alone

        This was after the early-19th century pogroms, the rest of his book is
        using dry humor of sarcasticdefamations of the word, “property,”

        Keynes, on the other hand, is concerned with funding the deficit. Marx,
        would wish there were none. Yes, the other answer is eloquent in calling
        Karl Marx’s anarchist, anticorporatist “market-communist,” government,
        provisional, as per Free Rider Immutable, Article 4 reigns, would surely
        suffice him, and with industry variable jury in determining the duress

        on capping rent by 5 units or 30 days, not price, would jive with his
        immediate outlay from corporate profit, flaccid collective loss
        thinking, as well. Very much can I envision Marx rolling over in his
        grave to the idea of nationalizing bridge/broadband fees instead of
        target margin, duress and quality (jail the led pipe network operational
        monopolies), INSTEAD of state victimization fine/bribe, as Keynes might

        _: “you are crazy,” isn’t scientific, and emotions are rational and
        normal. Crime is a crime, insanity is irrelevant, subjective and a
        racket! So you can take it like a clap back. Say “rollover insurance,”
        to an orthopedic surgeon and they will lock you up as a political
        prisoner in nj for 13 days. It has happened to me, on no grounds and if
        there was, no trial. Just an expiring claim by insurance RACKET! Illegal
        by surrendered freedom (EULA) of co-signatories’ customers and
        employers! Mental health is not the cause of homelessness, and drug use
        is as prevalent as those in accidents, per capita, not for alcohol.
        <br />
        <br />
        "Sorry for your bad experiences ... But I will have to agree to disagree
        with you on this one. People turn to drugs because of mental health
        issues unless they become addicted through treatment of another ailment,
        even then I will defer there is usually a mental health issue underlying
        it all. Sane people don't live homeless in the streets by choice
        usually....just saying."
        <br />
        <br />
        _: it is only because of rent seeking, evidenced by GDP/p 1800-1913
        nearly constant amongst 3%/year+. Drugs are fun. Walgreens/cops license
        for gentrification by gov. Open ingredient list will stop their excuses
        not to/continue licensure, racket jail. 10x hours per home (average
        traded value) since 1970 is 5 years to double, and not because we spend
        10x more per capita (hours and population is nearly fungible as basis
        for econometrics). It is an expected result that people are homeless
        with rent seeking, beyond plausible use of 5 units or 30 days (for
        hotels), debt income, $12k/64 debt/cash new per person per year as “free
        market,” making homes exorbitantly expensive, how can you expect people
        not to be angry. 65% are pro-Occupy/saver anti-rent-seeker. Emotions
        have nothing to do with it, and neither would it if they prefer it. You
        just want to racket incarceration with 40% debt spending for either
        expiring premiums in healthcare, or bond laundering in municipalities.
        Can even blame it on bridge toll nationalization for this 40% debt
        service in 50% debt spending nj, 1/3 public and private debt, all
        surrendered freedom of Savers, that is $2t CurrencyComponentOfM1 vs $88t
        debt. And you say it is emotions? You need a brain scan, maybe a
        lobotomy
        <br />
        <br />
        _: even dentists are in it for the expiring premiums, you have no right
        to psych hold.

        <br />
        "So you are saying ng the majority of the homeless are so because of
        greedy landlords?...NOT their own choices in life?"
        <br />
        <br />
        _: GDP/p 1800-1913 nearly constant says so, amongst 3%/yr+ population
        (it is just maths). Population growth doesn’t make scarcity, therefore,
        and high prices * long ACTUAL work days is because of actual labor
        shortage dead weight, not labor-borne-demand, Free-loaders (build a
        house, then sell it for competing for consumers, not with, lest be
        anti-trust prohibiting trade prosecuted), by implausible use landlords
        (cap 5 units or 30 days, not price caps misappropriation), non-rollover
        insurance, and other surrendered freedoms (EULA, third party donee due
        diligence onus on the contractor for co-signatories’ customers and
        employers, and Savers in general, is already illegal, technically).
        <br />
        <br />
        absurd tuition prices, reason why is perverting the market of
        general-income and compounding surrendered freedoms (EULA) of Savers,
        co-signatories' customers and employers for the due diligence of
        contractors to not knowingly rent seeking labor demand by actual labor
        shortage in demand.

        Home equity loans are like shorting if you are the lender, and fungible

        haven’t had a market crash of tightening then loosening, suspending
        market-ask outstanding share split Fed “purchases,” then continuing them
        abruptly chasing everyone into bonds, and 40% debt spending). Normal
        collateralized loans, the lenders’ profit depends on a positive
        correlation with collateral value if foreclosed, but with a HELOC their
        profits are capped by the principal, as foreclosure deducts from
        principal the price of the foreclosure sale (I would hope). Worst case

        "Can tighter monetary policy cause a recession?"
        <br />A recession, by the suspension of market-ask purchases, by
        share-split Savers, is when the debt isn’t serviced, drawing
        foreclosures. A recession is two consecutive quarters of lowering GDP,
        which is a sign of durable-trade, especially if per capita; if not, it
        could be less demand, more working age and lower prices of all input
        costs, including new homes. GDP does count new residential structures,
        single and multi family homes.

        <br />
        "Will the Fed’s rate hikes derail the economy?"
        <br />
        The Fed purchases enough outstanding market-ask bonds to permit the
        natural market to demand-bid at a near-constant interest rate.
        Suspending these open-market operations raises the interest rate, to
        which is necessarily bad, but not as bad as continuing to do the former.
        A good alternative would be to reverse amortize the surrendered freedoms
        of Savers (EULA, third party donee beneficiary), Truncated Production
        Tax Free Rider Immutable sewage police lawsuits, and 1-level board

          "Can a country print money to a certain degree without it leading to
          inflation?"
          <br />
          Printing money is feasibly a share-split, necessarily more than trade
          is consumed for the same work, so no. It also causes input costs other
          than material inflation to rise, as does debt, that which compels
          money-printing/share-split. The full list of input costs disclosed in
          poverty, gini, inflation, but not GDP (m2 velocity per year is mutual
          funds), is bonds, homes, equities, labor, profits, and
          rent-/material-inflations.

          "Is there really a supply shortage causing inflation?"
          <br />
          Supply shortage hardly happens because of labor competition, evidenced
          by GDP/p nearly constant 1800–1913, amongst 3%/yr+ population, unless
          it is natural resource scarcity, for actual consumption. There is much
          room to fall in GDP/p from now that is durable-trade. Therefore, the
          cause of inflation is actual labor shortage by working age deficit and
          finance/rent-seeking (invoices, estimated claims, expiring premiums,
          implausible landlord use, repo-cycle kept down payments), not a
          shortage of natural resources or too many people.

        Checking is the account depositary, fungible for cash in that exact
        amount, usually with the business model of transaction/monthly fees. You
        might be thinking of “savings,” accounts, that are actually
        bond-index-fund investment. There isn’t a need for the latter, just
        excess gluttony for laborless-demand and trust against the working
        consumer, merely for higher bid price over constant actual
        durable-goods, material “inflation,” and other input costs. It is also
        technically-illegal, being the surrendered freedom of others (EULA,
        third party donee beneficiary claimable of Savers’ checking).

          you’re no better than Mark Levin saying monthly “savings” without
          amortizing premiums and expiring insurance (false pool bids) public

              That’s right, and there is not a new precedent of illegality
              required to be mounted. In order to use the service, we must agree
              to share data with unnecessary third parties. That is an agreement
              made under duress, to not be a slave to a non-inclusive economy.
              When a service becomes so predominant and there aren’t as many
              tech alternatives as there are corner-store alternatives, it
              becomes less of a choice and more of slavery, giving but unable to
              take without harm of sharing data to marketmakers and
              non-abstracted advertising services in the platform. Data
              collection by any other means than for use in-platform is a
              contract to give up the right to hide expression and generally not
              do harm to oneself in order to be included. That doesn’t include
              in-network advertising since that could be considered necessary
              for the product; yet as another issue, in my tests, the
              impressions or responses on in-network Facebook ads are fake
              profiles. Certainly requires an audit

              Nicholas Carducci shared 12/29/2020 I don't believe there is one
              morsel of debt or consumer royalty that is not akin to
              colonialism, but on a market-specific level. I do believe that a
              Class-action-suit could be filed for reversing funds back to 1913
              to each year's cash:debt level. Most GDP is debt, and only 50% has
              been going back to personal income (everything saved is lent for
              more than exists). In fact, there is not one debt or payday loan
              that could not be argued for the above remedy a as a solution with
              Amendment 13, the Sherman Act prohibiting trade (and renting-out
              more places to use/sell for yourself by the way). It is wagering
              others' money unless it is a business partnership on the merits of
              an invention or team, since that individual has patrons or that
              individual cannot BE, while a business contract can exist while
              not eating, with health and in shelter. Wagering someone else's
              money is so in debt and consumer royalty but not business
              location/customer/intellectual-property royalty with max profit.
              I'd pref copyright as the extent of IP as a consumer and web
              product owner... I may have to be a medical inventor to care, but
              only to consider time spent in invention and thereby scope of
              copyright.

              Thanks for the contribution. It seems to cover several points. I
              will search for some literature, off-line, to see how one can
              pyramid the content and converge it within the issues of triggers
              and propellers of over indebtedness. Much appreciated. In the
              meantime, could you kindly favour the forum with a copy of the
              Amendment 13, the Sherman Act at all? It would be much
              appreciated.

              I believe these U.S. laws describe the following as illegal:
              <br />
              <br />
              debt, {">"}1month rent and invoices if involuntary trade is
              servitude and monopolization is colonization of a market without
              producing, buying or closing a trade by promising money that they
              do not own.

              This is the U.S. Constitution Amendment 13: "Neither slavery nor
              involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof
              the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the
              United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction." <br />
              <br />
              The Sherman Act according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission:
              "The Sherman Act outlaws 'every contract, combination, or
              conspiracy in restraint of trade," and any "monopolization,
              attempted monopolization, or conspiracy or combination to
              monopolize.'"

              <br />
              Finally, I hope you can apply the following rubicons and triggers
              as a point of over-indebtedness. Debt is a currency stockholder
              decision, but distribution of profit and outlays is not. The
              trigger is the first usurped contract promising other peoples'
              money and under duress by others price-fixing to also borrow under
              a prisoner's dilemma situation. You may also try to estimate how
              much of the debt would be invested in commodities, property,
              equity/royalty or royalty with max-profit if debt & renting-out
              more than 5 properties out were banned to highlight a numerical or
              relational investment to capita or cash outstanding trigger to be
              promised based on investor-diligence of actually getting money
              back without private lender intervention, not cashing-out at
              price-fixed valuations or inevitably extending terms or
              foreclosing for the asset they should have bought from the start
              themselves if they want it... That is where I would define the
              point of becoming over-indebted if I were to assume, for this
              instance, "indebt" also could mean the royalty with max-profit
              alternative.

                Otherwise, promising other people's and your customers' money to
                prohibit them from buying the product directly is too much
                [illegally-cornering weed not by trade but duress, price-fixing,
                counterfeit, involuntary servitude and entrapment], but
                promising a portion of a business line that is not a
                living-being but a switch to distribute money is a
                fine[legally-finding price by trade elasticity]-amount of

              {space} In my technology solution for this (vaults.biz in
              development 2020-22) I will give the entrepreneur the option to
              sell royalty with max-profit contracts with either an
              upon-withdrawal or an upon-sale tract for automated-distribution
              and withdrawal-caps. I believe the impossible contract depending
              on the consent of another will prove to always garner more
              investment than royalty with max-profit might, and more will turn
              to equity/royalty, commodity or vault-share certificates, but that
              would be your over-indebtedness number in my book, in addition to
              the over-promising made by any consumer or time-based debt at all.
              For geospatial instance, the total debt in the U.S. price-fixes
              and pays out at $82 trillion : $6 trillion cash in mid-2020.

            The largest atrocity in the history of mankind is the ability to
            call an investment account a savings account, second to instead of

            the Federal Reserve being compelled to print for interest.

            The solution to the second problem of majeure compelling debasement
            is to use the ability to set max-profit in any payment-schedule's
            curve on royalty, so the entrepreneur can raise without giving
            equity. If debt were banned, this would take over as a comparably
            liquid option, yet more efficient in how assets are traded by owners
            as it only requires disbursements after revenue. These would not be
            persons, medical practices or cross-industry studios, just
            investments in development projects. This last requirement is to
            ensure that the investment is not used for consumer purchases, and
            the lender does not get money from income outside of their
            investment from the borrower so that the borrower may continue to
            work for others.
            <br />
            <br />
            A supporting solution to the second problem of majeure compelling
            debasement is to ban invoices after fair warning so that contractors
            must receive payment from customers in advance & services cannot
            charge more than the customer has in non-credit assets.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another supporting solution to the second problem of majeure
            compelling debasement is to ban insurance because they take in more
            value than they deliver, only to raise price which is not
            investment's original purpose in university economics. If their
            value is curation, then create a website.
            <br />
            <br />
            The solution to the first problem of misleading customers is to
            ensure that "depository institution," "depository," "savings,"
            "savings account," or "securities" are designated trademark terms
            for accounts that DO NOT LEND and ARE NOT BONDS. Ensure that all
            "investment vehicles" are clearly labeled as such in trade as well.
